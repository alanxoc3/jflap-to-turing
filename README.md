# jflap-to-turing
Converts Jflap turing machine files to turing machine simulator format.

## About
[JFlap](http://www.jflap.org/) is a fairly old state machine simulation program that doesn't seem to have been updated for a while. To make things worse, it has limited and many broken features for Turing Machine Simulations. Many students taking Computational Theory at BYU-Idaho have been writing their Turing Machine Simulations in JFlap. I had to grade these machines, but doing that with JFlap is a terrible experience. Thus **jflap-to-turing** was born!

This program simply converts a JFlap Turing Machine file (.jff) into the online format at https://turingmachinesimulator.com/.

## Features
* Multiple Tapes Supported!
* Keeps State Names!
* Nice CLI!
* Allows you to test your turing machine, **WITHOUT JFLAP!!!!**

## Demo

## Todo
* Make parsing work with JFlap groups.
